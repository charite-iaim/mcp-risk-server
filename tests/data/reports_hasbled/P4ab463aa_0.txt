Patient ID: P4ab463aa
Name: Maria Keller
Date of Birth: 28.03.1981
Discharge Date: 15.07.2025
Sex: Female
The patient has well-controlled blood pressure, with systolic values consistently below 160 mmHg during hospitalization (average systolic BP: 128 mmHg).
The patient does not have chronic kidney disease, is not on dialysis, has never had a kidney transplant, and is not receiving chronic renal replacement therapy. Her most recent serum creatinine level was 0.89 mg/dL (within normal limits).
The patient has no history of liver cirrhosis and no clinical or imaging evidence of chronic liver disease. Laboratory values show AST at 28 U/L, ALT at 35 U/L, and ALP at 72 U/L. Her total bilirubin is measured at 0.7 mg/dL.
The patient has no prior history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
There is no documented history of major bleeding events, including intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding requiring hospitalization, transfusion, or endoscopic intervention.
The patient is not on warfarin therapy; therefore, INR variability is not applicable. However, when INR has been measured for unrelated reasons, it has remained within the normal therapeutic range more than 50% of the time.
The patient is not taking any antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin or clopidogrel) or NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) at the time of discharge.
The patient reports no alcohol consumption currently or in the past 12 months.
As a female, the patient’s hemoglobin level is 12.6 g/dL, which is above the 12 g/dL threshold and thus not contributing to anemia-associated bleeding risk.

	•	Metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily (for supraventricular tachycardia)
